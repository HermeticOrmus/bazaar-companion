## Key Mechanics

### Cooldown Reduction (CDR)
The king stat. More activations = more power.

### Haste
Temporary super-CDR. Almost always good.

### Crit Chance
Multiplies EVERYTHING:
- Damage
- Healing
- Shields
Late-game scaling monster.

### Charge
Instantly advance item cooldown → immediate activation.

### Freeze
Frozen items don't charge or activate. Counter this.

### Lifesteal
Regain health from damage dealt.
**Not counted as healing** - bypasses anti-heal.

### Multicast
Item activates multiple times at once. Amplifies dramatically.

### Burn
Damage that decreases each second.
**Shield reduces burn by 50%**

## Item Tiers
- Bronze/Silver: Days 1-2
- Gold/Diamond: Days 5+

## Board Space
Limited slots. Small items early, consolidate into powerful items later.
